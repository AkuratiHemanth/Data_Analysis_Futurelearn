# **FutureLearn Data Analysis Project**  

This repository contains the analysis of the FutureLearn data, following the principles of the CRISP-DM methodology. The investigation focuses on uncovering insights that could benefit FutureLearn course providers. The work involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and reporting, all structured using the `ProjectTemplate` framework.

---

## **Repository Structure**

This project follows the directory structure generated by the `ProjectTemplate` package. Below is an explanation of each folder:

### **1. Data**
- Contains the raw FutureLearn data files used for analysis.
- Modifications made to the files in this folder, by making all the required datasets into one folder called *"raw"* folder; and all transformations are handled in the `Munge` scripts.

### **2. Munge**
- Houses R scripts for preprocessing and cleaning the raw data.
- Includes:
  - Handling missing data.
  - Data type transformations.
  - Feature engineering, if applicable.

### **3. Cache**
- Contains cached versions of the preprocessed data.
- This allows for faster loading during the analysis phase without repeatedly running the munging scripts.

### **4. Config**
- Contains configuration settings for the `ProjectTemplate` environment.
- Adjustments to settings (if any) are documented in the comments within the configuration files.

### **5. Reports**
- Contains the analysis report written in R Markdown.
- Includes:
  - Comprehensive insights from two CRISP-DM cycles.
  - Visualizations and detailed explanations of the analysis process and findings.

## **Steps to Reproduce the Analysis**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure the following software is installed on your system:
- R (version >= 4.0)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Git

Additionally, install the following R packages if not already available:
```R
install.packages(c("ProjectTemplate", "renv", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```

### **2. Setup Project Environment**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkuratiHemanth/Data_Analysis_Futurelearn
   cd Data_Analysis_Futurelearn
   ```
2. Restore the project environment using `renv`:
   ```R
   renv::restore()
   ```

### **3. Running the Analysis**
1. Open the R project in RStudio.
2. Load the `ProjectTemplate` environment:
   ```R
   library(ProjectTemplate)
   load.project()
   ```
3. The preprocessing scripts in the `Munge` folder will automatically run to prepare the data.
4. Navigate to the `Reports` folder and knit the R Markdown file to generate the final report:
   ```R
   rmarkdown::render("Reports/Analysis_Report.Rmd")
   ```

## **Deliverables**

### **1. Analysis Report**
- Location: `Reports/Analysis_Report.html`
- Contains the results of the two CRISP-DM cycles, including data insights and recommendations for FutureLearn.

### **2. Git Log**
- Location: `GitLog.txt`
- Documents the Git history for the project.

### **3. Preprocessed Data**
- Location: `Cache/`
- Preprocessed data files used in the analysis.

### **4. renv Lockfile**
- Location: `renv.lock`
- Ensures reproducibility of the project’s R package environment.

## **CRISP-DM Methodology**

The analysis follows two iterations of the CRISP-DM framework:
1. **Cycle 1**: Focused on exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and anomalies.
2. **Cycle 2**: Focused on detailed hypothesis testing and generating actionable insights for FutureLearn course providers.

Each cycle is documented in the analysis report, with step-by-step details of the methods used and findings.

---

## **Key Insights**

The key findings from the analysis are outlined in the report. Here’s a brief summary of the focus areas investigated:
1. Course engagement trends across different categories and demographics.
2. Factors influencing learner retention and dropout rates.
3. Patterns in learner feedback and ratings.

For the full analysis and recommendations, refer to `Reports/Analysis_Report.html`.
